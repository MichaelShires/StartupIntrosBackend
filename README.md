# Startup Intros

## Introduction
This is the beginning of the Startup Intros data sourcing project. Currently, it allows for a news source (such as an RSS feed) to be fed into it. Then it pulls all posts from any RSS feed available.
It uses SQLite for now, but adding a connection string to an external database should be trivial.

## Future Work
Future steps are to connect it to the OpenAI API to run each post through an LLM to obtain useful data.

## Contributions
